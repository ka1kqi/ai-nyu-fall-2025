This is code for creating clauses to solve a maze, where we are to collect all the treasures in order to escape. The clauses are created by generating strings written in Datalog-like form from information provided in an input file, and then atomizing them by mapping them into a Sym Table. The mapped atoms are then placed into clauses, which are provided to the DPLL algorithm to solve. The result is then parsed and output.
